# NIST Open-Source Software Repository Template

<!-- Text within tags like these are comments, and will not
     appear online. Feel free to delete them from your copy. -->

## Description

<!-- Required. Please replace the text in this section with a
     summary of the work this repository represents, or intends
     to. Sub-sections describing file contents can/should be
     removed, or replaced with a file format or folder hierarchy
     description. -->

Use of GitHub by NIST employees for government work is subject to
the [Rules of Behavior for GitHub][gh-rob]. This is the
recommended template for NIST employees, since it contains
required files with approved text. For details, please consult
the Office of Data & Informatics' [Quickstart Guide to GitHub at
NIST][gh-odi].

Please click on the green **Use this template** button above to
create a new repository under the [usnistgov][gh-nst]
organization for your own open-source work. Please do not "fork"
the repository directly, and do not create the templated
repository under your individual account.

The key files contained in this repository -- which will also
appear in templated copies -- are listed below, with some things
to know about each.

### README

Each repository will contain a [README file][wk-rdm], preferably
formatted using [GitHub-flavored Markdown][gh-mdn] and named
`README.md` (this file). It must contain:

1. Software or Data description
   - Statements of purpose and maturity
   - Technical installation instructions
1. Contact information
   - PI name, NIST OU, Division, and Group names
   - Contact email address at NIST
   - Details of mailing lists, chatrooms, and discussion forums,
     where applicable
1. Related Material
   - URL for associated project on <nist.gov> or other Department of
     Commerce site, if available
   - References to user guides if stored outside of GitHub
1. Directions on appropriate citation with example text
1. References to any included non-public domain software modules, and
   additional license language if needed, *e.g.* [BSD][li-bsd],
   [GPL][li-gpl], or [MIT][li-mit]

### Terms of Use: `LICENSE.md`

Each repository will contain a file named `LICENSE.md` that is
phrased in compliance with the Public Access to NIST Research
[*Copyright, Fair Use, and Licensing Statement for SRD, Data, and
Software*][nist-open].

- The version of [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) included in this
  repository is approved for use.
- When in doubt, copy and include the contents of the relevant
  statement inside a "blue box" in its entirety
- As subsections of [THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md),
  include copyright and licensing statements of any third-party
  software that are legally bundled with the code in compliance with
  the conditions of those licenses. If this does not apply, you may
  delete that file.

### CODEOWNERS

This template repository includes a file named
[CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS), which visitors can view to discover
which GitHub users are "in charge" of the repository. More
crucially, GitHub uses it to assign reviewers on pull requests.
GitHub documents the file (and how to write one) [here][gh-cdo].

***Please update this file*** to point to your own account or
team, so that the [Open-Source Team][gh-ost] doesn't get spammed
with spurious review requests. *Thanks!*

### Repository Metadata: `CODEMETA.yaml`

This repository includes a file named `CODEMETA.yaml`, used by
the NIST Software Portal to sort your work under the appropriate

## Contact Information

<!-- Required section. Please list your project's developers
     instead of the opensource-repo team. Note that NIST
     employees are required to list their email address in their
     GitHub profile, so the general public can get in touch. -->

[usnistgov/opensource-repo][gh-osr] is developed and maintained
by the [opensource-team][gh-ost], principally:

- Gretchen Greene, @GRG2
- Yannick Congo, @faical-yannick-congo
- Trevor Keller, @tkphd

This information is also reflected in [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS).
